# <A study guide for course pre-work>

## Description



- What was your motivation?
I want to create a web application that can track my progress on the BootCamp and provide me with a platform which I can update with newfound knowledge as a I progress through the Bootcamp. It should serve as a reminder of past tasks completed, and provide a framework for my development goals. I hope I can come back to this application in the future to see what new skills I have learnt, when, and how I implemented them. It will serve as a nice little reminder of how far I have progressed over time as it will allow me to track my knowledge progression. I need a place where I can store all information pertaining to the Bootcamp assignments, so this application serves that purpose. I have learnt web applications are built fromm HTML, JS and CSS so far, and implemented a few lines of code for each to enable the barebones content of the application.

## Usage

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
